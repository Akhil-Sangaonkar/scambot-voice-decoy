## ü§ñ LiveChatBot Class: A Voice-Enabled Time-Wasting Conversational Agent

The `LiveChatBot` class is designed to interact with scam callers, keeping them engaged by simulating a slightly confused but overly polite persona. It leverages speech recognition, language modeling, and text-to-speech synthesis to create an interactive voice-based agent.

### Key Components:
1. **Whisper Model** (Speech-to-Text)
   - The `LiveChatBot` uses OpenAI's `Whisper` model for transcribing audio input into text. This allows it to understand the scam caller's speech.

2. **Llama Model** (Language Model)
   - A language model (Gemma 3:1b) is used to generate a nonsensical, slightly confused response to keep the scam caller engaged.

3. **TTS Model** (Text-to-Speech)
   - The bot uses Coqui's `TTS` for converting text back into speech to respond to the scam caller in a natural-sounding voice.
